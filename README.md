SunPy - AGU 2011

Observational Characteristics
-----------------------------

from [Warmuth et al. (2010)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AdSpR..45..527W)

 * "We stress that all studied events show the same basic characteristics: the signatures in all wavelength ranges – Ha, HeI, EUV, and SXR – are consistent with a single underlying physical disturbance. In all cases, the disturbance is decelerating. This is seen from the combined kinematical curves as well as in the individual data sets from the various spectral channels. 
 * "There is a relation between the amount of deceleration and propagation speeds: faster waves tend to decelerate more strongly."

from [Warmuth et al. (2004)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004A%26A...418.1117W)

 * Fitting the profiles using a second-order polynomial fit (r = r0 + v0*t + 1/2*a0*t^2) for 12 events.
 * The mean parameters were found to be v0 = 933 +/- 252 km/s, a0 = −1495 +/- 1262 m/s^2.

from [Long et al. 2011](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011SPD....42.0505L)

 * "Significant pulse broadening was also measured using both STEREO ( 55 km/s) andSDO ( 65 km/s) observations."
